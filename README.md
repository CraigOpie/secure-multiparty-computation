# Secure Multiparty Computation

Welcome to the repository for secure multiparty computation (SMPC) project!

This repository contains a collection of tools and algorithms for performing secure computations in a collaborative environment. SMPC allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their private inputs, without revealing anything except the output.  This implementation of SMPC solves for a basic "greater than" problem - also know as [Yao's Millionaires' Problem](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/areas/sec/yao1982-ocr.pdf).  The Yao's Millionaires' Problem, introduced in 1982 by computer scientist Andrew Yao, is a secure multi-party computation issue where two millionaires, Alice and Bob, aim to determine their relative wealth without revealing their actual financial information.

## Features
- Implementations of various SMPC protocols and techniques
